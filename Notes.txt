Numpy
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/index.html
• N-dimensional Array Object
Functions to operate on the NDARRAY
• Large datasets can be operated in less time
http://pynash.org/2013/03/06/timing-and-profiling/
%time -> See how long it takes a script to run.
%timeit -> See how long a script takes to run averaged over multiple runs.
%prun -> See how long it took each function in a script to run.
%lprun -> See how long it took each line in a function to run.
%mprun -> See how much memory a script uses line by line
%memit -> See how much memory a script uses overall
Numpy’s NDARRAY provides the fundamental data structure for other packages
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/basics.types.html
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html
Numpy Basics
• Creating 1-D and 2-D Numpy Arrays
• Scalar Operations
• Vector Operations
• Accessing Values
Boolean Indexing
• Filtering, Logical Operations, Substitution
• View and In-place
Universal Functions(ufunc)
A universal function (or ufunc for short) is a function that operates on ndarrays in an element-by-element fashion
Apply operations on array elements
Arranging, Squaring, Square root, Compare the elements of NDARRAY

Pandas
• Complex Data Structure for housing data
• Powerful Functions for manipulating data
• Data Structures
1.) Series (Array like)
2.) DataFrame (Spreadsheet like)
• Built on Numpy
• Creating Panda series
1.) From a Numpy Array
2.) From a List
3.) From a Dictionary
View three Series side-by-side
Meaningful Indexes
Accessing Values
1.) All Values
2.) All Indexes
Len, Size, Shape
Index Value tests
Head and Tail
Accessing value by Index
Position-based and Label-based lookup
1.) Use .loc for Label based lookup
2.) Use .iloc for Position based lookup
3.) Use .ix to lookup by Label or by Position
Enumeration
Naming
• Vector Operations
• Logical and String Operations
• Miscellaneous

Data Frames
1.) Initializing a DataFrame from a Dictionary
2.) Initializing a DataFrame from a Series
• Changing the index
• Head and Tail
• Access values in data frames
1.) Fetch columns
2.) Fetch Row by Label
3.) Fetch Column by Label
4.) Fetch by Label but fall back on integer position based
5.) Fetching using Row,Column Combinations
6.) Fast label based lookup with .at
7.) .iat for using Location Based

Filters and Operations
• Statistics
• Indexes

Apply Functions
• Data transformation
• Apply to each cell
• Apply to rows
• Apply to columns

Split-Apply-Combine
• Split : groupby()
• Apply : aggregate, transform, filter
• Combine : combine results
